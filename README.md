Description:
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic. (1) This dataset was shared publicly and is available from many different websites. All the data collected and displayed is made freely available, initially as google sheets and now in a GitHub repository. I've created a similar dashboard using dataset available. It illustrates the location and number of confirmed COVID-19 cases for all affected countries.

Initially, you can see a filled graph for cases overtime all over the world as Figure 1 . you can select a particular window for looking closely at the graph. There is toggle option and slider on the date lets you select a particular time frame. The world cases are shown with a world map. Figure 2 represents a bubble map. Bubble map has Hover and point feature for all the countries in the world map. You can use the Zoom and pan functionality. One can click on the country name to show the bubble for only those particular countries on the right. The larger the bubble, the more number of cases. Figure 3 represents a Chorolopeth map. It is a geographical map which shows the variation in the number of cases. It uses different shades from the colour scale range. The above graph represents that the USA has the most number of cases amongst all with the purple shade. Other countries like Spain, Italy, France and Germany also show a large number of cases and thus are coloured in pink.

As of 27 April 2020, more than 3 million cases have been reported across 185 countries and territories, resulting in more than 206,000 deaths. More than 865,000 people have recovered. Out of these confirmed cases, the USA is about to hit 1 million confirmed cases. Thus, taking a keen interest in the details, I created a map specifically for the states affected in the USA. Figure 4 is an extremely interactive graph and one of the main visualization for looking at the affected states and the increase overtime with a line graph. The graph has date as X-axis and cases in Y-axis.Figure 5 shows us the total number of cases in USA overtime in both log and linear fashion which can be chosen from the dropdown menu.For those who have a visual learning style, I have created a choropleth map as Figure 6 for states in the USA which has pretty much the same features as figure 2
